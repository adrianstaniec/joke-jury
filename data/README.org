* Datasets

Datasets are held in tab-separated-vale files, one joke per line.

They were created with scraping scripts and some manual cleanup.

** English jokes

Two datasets available.

** Polish jokes

The dataset is commited, but suffers from bad quality labels, so manual rating is required.

Just run the script below to read and rate the unrated jokes yourself.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
./labeling_pl.py
#+END_SRC

Don't forget to commit your work. ;)
